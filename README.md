#Microservices toolchain

Get started with this sample, which is an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The sample includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and messaging.

###Lab 1: An introduction to microservices

To get started, click this button:

[![Deploy To Bluemix](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/?repository=https%3A//github.com/eciggaar/ms-store-toolchain.git)

After the creation of this toolchain, you can explore the possibilities of the microservices toolchain via the tutorial listed below:

The first part is just for reviewing purposes. Don't click the **Create toolchain** button in part 1. You already did this using the button on this page.

###Lab 2: From a monolithic application to microservices

The articles below guide you in converting a monolithic application into a microservices based application using Docker and IBM Bluemix. To start, use the button below to deploy the monolithic app in your own Bluemix organization.
